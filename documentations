### Structure Changes ###
Basic changes worth to note.

## Gamedata ##
1. productdata, furnidata, external_variables, external_texts come from Hashes now.
2. Hash requirements
- JSON including link & hash. Changing the HASH will reload it inside the SWF. You get an example from https://habbo.com/gamedata/hashes

## Basic Assets ##
- Badges are now .png (we can make seperate SWFs for .gif | .png, but for the purpose of this project we'll do it in .png :heart:
